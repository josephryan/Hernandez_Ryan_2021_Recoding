## phylotocol_recodingextension_v1.0.pdf
Our analysis did not address compositional heterogeneity and since we used the same model for simulation and testing, we did not consider problems stemming from poor model fit. As such, this phylotocol serves as an extension of our previous analysis (phylotocol_recoding_v1.pdf) to address these concerns.

## phylotocol_recodingextension_v1.1.pdf
Changed the way we will perform simulations and calculations of compositional heterogeneity in section 2.3 of the phylotocol by using straightforward methods in P4 (Foster 2004). 

## phylotocol_recodingextension_v1.2.pdf
Changed methods in section 2.3 because we could not adequately simulate and test compositional heterogeneity. We have changed the tree we will use for simulations and the method we will use to evaluate tree reconstructions.

## phylotocol_recodingextension_v1.3.pdf
We added methods under section 2.3.7 to test for statistical significance of results from 2.3.6. We also added section 2.4 to test alternative Dayhoff recoding strategies.
