# Scripts to simulate and test compositionally heterogeneous datasets of varying size

### chunkify_estimate.pl
recodes simulated datasets using Dayhoff 6-state recoding and S&R 6-state recoding and generates shell scripts for maximum-likelihood analyses in RAxML

### comphet_bargraph_size.R
produces a bar graph showing the percentage of incorrect trees reconstructed under each method and level of compositional heterogeneity (inflation parameter) tested for datasets of varying size. This script uses the file comp_het_proportion_reconstruction.csv
