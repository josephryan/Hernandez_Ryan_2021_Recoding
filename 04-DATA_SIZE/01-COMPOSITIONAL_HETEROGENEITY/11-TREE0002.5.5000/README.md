# Directory in which to run simulations using tree 0.002, inflation parameter 0.5, and sequence lengths of 5000 amino acid columns

directory to simulate compositionally heterogeneous datasets using tree 0.002, inflation parameter 0.5, and 5000 amino acid columns

### all.out
this file only contains the number 0 and is used to meet the parameter settings since we did not simulate a null distribution for these analyses
